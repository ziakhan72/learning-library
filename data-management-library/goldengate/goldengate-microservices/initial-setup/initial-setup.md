# Configure Database and GoldenGate Users 

## Introduction

In this lab we will setup the required database and GoldeGate replication users.

*Estimated Lab Time*:  60 minutes

### Lab Architecture

### Objectives

Understanding how to prepare and setup an Oracle Database for replication and define users for replication. Users are created using scripts that populate the multitenanant environment with required Oracle Users while applying aliases to be used by GoldenGate. The Databases used in this lab are identified using the SOE schema in source and targets.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- SSH Private Key to access the host via SSH
- You have completed:
    - Lab: Generate SSH Keys
    - Lab: Prepare Setup
    - Lab: Environment Setup
    - Lab: Configure GoldenGate

In this lab we will setup GoldenGate Microservices

## **STEP 1:** Configure Database 

1. Open a terminal session.

````
<copy>sudo su - oracle</copy>
````

2. In the open Terminal Window, start SQL*Plus.

```
<copy>lsnrctl start</copy>
```

```
<copy>sqlplus /as sysdba</copy>
```

```
<copy>startup</copy>
```

3. Enable the database for GoldenGate replication.

```
<copy>alter system set enable_goldengate_replication=true scope=both;</copy>
```

4.	Enable Archive Log on the database.This will require you to shut down the database and restart it.

5. Shutdown the database.

```
<copy>shutdown immediate;</copy>
```

6. Start the database up in mount mode.

```
<copy>startup mount;</copy>
```

7. Change database into Archive Log mode.

```
<copy>alter database archivelog;</copy>
```
![](./images/z5.png " ")

8. Open the database.

```
<copy>alter database open;</copy>
```

![](./images/z6.png " ")

9.	Open the Pluggable Database
```
<copy>alter pluggable database all open read write;</copy>
```
10. Enable Minimal Supplemental Logging for the database.  Additionally, enable Force Logging then switch the log file.

```
<copy>alter database add supplemental log data;</copy>
```
```
<copy>alter database force logging;</copy>
```
```
<copy>alter system switch logfile;</copy>
```

## **STEP 2:** Create the GoldenGate users needed at the Container Database and Pluggable Database Layers

1. From SQL*Plus run the following SQL statements to create the Common User within the Container Database (CDB).

```
<copy> create user c##ggate identified by ggate quota unlimited on USERS account unlock;
grant connect, dba, resource to c##ggate;</copy>
```
```
<copy>begin
SYS.DBMS_GOLDENGATE_AUTH.GRANT_ADMIN_PRIVILEGE('C##GGATE', container=>'ALL');
end;
/</copy>
```

2. From SQL*Plus, run the following SQL statements to create the GoldenGate users for the Pluggable database (PDB)
```
<copy>alter session set container = oggoow19;
grant connect, dba to c##ggate;
create user GGATE identified by ggate quota unlimited on USERS account unlock;
grant connect, dba to ggate;
alter session set container = oggoow191;
grant connect, dba to c##ggate;
create user GGATE identified by ggate quota unlimited on USERS account unlock;
grant connect, dba to ggate;
exit</copy>
```
## Summary

Oracle GoldenGate offers high-performance, fault-tolerant, easy-to-use, and flexible real- time data streaming platform for big data environments. It easily extends customersâ€™ real-time data
integration architectures to big data systems without impacting the performance of the source systems and enables timely business insight for better decision making.

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
